Generate Network Traffic for Packet Capture

Objective:
To simulate real-world network activity and capture packets using Wireshark.

Action Performed:
- Opened Firefox browser in Kali VM.
- Visited the following URL:
  https://www.kernel.org/

Protocols Triggered:
- DNS (domain resolution for www.kernel.org)
- TLS (encrypted HTTPS session)
- TCP (connection setup and teardown)

Wireshark was actively capturing during this session.
Screenshots were taken directly from the full packet list view.
No display filters were applied during capture or screenshot.
IP addresses are visible in the screenshots for technical clarity.

This confirms successful traffic generation and packet capture for analysis.
