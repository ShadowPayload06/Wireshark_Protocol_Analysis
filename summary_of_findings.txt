Analyze captured packets and identify key protocols

Capture File: wireshark_capture_day5_task5.pcap  
Total Packets Captured: 622  
Protocols Filtered: HTTP, DNS, TCP, TLS  

Summary of Findings:

1. HTTP Traffic:
   - Observed HTTP GET request to a web server.
   - Request path: /access/scraping?hl=en
   - Headers included: User-Agent, Accept
   - Indicates active web browsing or automated scraping.

2. DNS Traffic:
   - DNS queries sent to public DNS servers.
   - Domain resolution attempts observed.
   - Confirms hostname-to-IP resolution activity.

3. TCP Traffic:
   - TCP handshake and termination packets captured.
   - SYN, ACK, FIN flags confirm session lifecycle.
   - Multiple client-server connections established.

4. TLS Traffic:
   - Encrypted communication using TLSv1.3.
   - Handshake and application data packets observed.
   - Confirms secure HTTPS traffic during session.

Privacy Notes:
- All IP addresses have been redacted.
- Screenshots of filtered views are included for each protocol.

Conclusion:
The capture confirms typical client-server communication involving web browsing, DNS resolution, encrypted HTTPS sessions, and TCP session management. 
Each protocol was successfully filtered and documented with screenshots and summaries.
